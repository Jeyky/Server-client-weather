/**
 * A simple program that decreace number of requsets to weather API.
 *
 *	Copyright 2020, Volodymyr Teslenko <Jeyky @ github>
 *
 * This is server program that decrease number of requests to
 * API(In this case to weather API) by saving data in it's own storage
 * and comparing new client's requests with relevance of data that already
 * exist on server. If client makes request to the data which is not relevant,
 * server makes request to api saves in owns storage and sends to client.
 * For example if several clients makes request "Kyiv", server makes only one
 * request to api and sends the same data to clients.
 * Takes maximum one command line argument 'port'. Defaukt port 3622
 * Creates directory "Cities" where all the data storaged.
 * Create logs.txt and saves there logging information.
